Implementing 6 different FFT/IFFT algorithms for OFDM system

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is widely used in many digital communication systems due to its advantages such us high bit rate, strong immunity to multipath and high spectral efficiency. In other words, we could say that Multiple sub-channels (sub-carriers) carry samples sent at a lower rate. This is achieved by using Almost same bandwidth with wide-band channel. One of the most important parts of this procedure is Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), which plays a significant role in making a change in the world of communication and we will discuss how this is approached later in the paper. In this Project we investigate various algorithms for performing Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT)/Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT). Those algorithms are being used in the process of implementation the FFT/IFFT part in Orthogonal Frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
